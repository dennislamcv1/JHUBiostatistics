## Biostatistics in Public Health
### About this Specialization


This specialization is intended for public health and healthcare  professionals, researchers, data analysts, social workers, and others who need a comprehensive concepts-centric biostatistics primer.  Those who complete the specialization will be able to read and respond to the scientific literature, including the Methods and Results sections, in public health, medicine, biological science, and related fields. Successful learners will also be prepared to participate as part of a research team.

### Applied Learning Project

In each course, learners will assume the role of a biostatistical consultant helping research teams review and interpret the published scientific literature. Throughout the specializations, learners will return to two important studies, one on asthma medication and another on injectable contraception, to answer the researchers' questions about the published statistical methods and results.
